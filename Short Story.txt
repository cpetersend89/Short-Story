It was a cold and gloomy day when I lost my leg; a day that I will never forget.
The day started out normal - quite boring actually.  I was sleeping in bed with my four cats when my pesky alarm went off alerting me to begin my day.
I reached over to hit snooze as I was doing my self a favor by allowing myself to sleep for an extra eight minutes.
"RING RING RING" coming from that devilish device nagging me as my mother used to do when I was in grade school.
"I am an adult now, leave me alone!" I screamed abruptly at my phone as if it was my mother.
Coming to my senses I was pleased to know that it was just my pink Razr flip phone was was screeming at me.
I turned off my alarm and made the mature decision to get out of bed and begin my day.

A typical morning at my house is quite exhilarating so brace yourself.
After I sluggishly crawl out of bed with my comforter draped around me like a superhero cape, I wander into the kitchen to make some coffee and delecious oatmeal.
While I am waiting for my meal to finish cooking, I shed off my comforter full of cat hair and put on the outfit that I am going to wear to impress the world.
I then walk into the bathroom and stare at myself in the mirror for a few minutes wondering what happened throughout the night that made my hair so messy.
